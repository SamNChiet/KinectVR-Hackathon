# KinectVR-Hackathon

KinectVR is a full body positional tracking VR framework made in 24 hours at Los Altos Hacks.
KinectVR is an addon for the Unity Game Engine, and provides a skeletal model of the user to interact with however you wish.

#Hardware
Requires an Oculus Rift (we used a DK2 without having the tracker plugged in) and a KinectV2

#Plans
Possible integration of augmented reality, we were able to get 3d pointdata info from the Kinect, but with the processing power available from the laptop, we were unable to integrate it into a demoable experience.

#The Software
Included are two demo scenes, one for a virtual desktop, and soccer. Both of these should give an example usage of the framework.
